For React projects, I leverage the latest Next.js features including the App Router, Server Components, and static site generation to deliver blazing-fast performance and excellent SEO. For WordPress projects, I build custom themes and plugins that give clients full control over their content without sacrificing design quality or site speed.`,

From <span class="font-bold hover:text-sky-400 cursor-pointer">planning and design</span> to <span class="font-bold hover:text-sky-400 cursor-pointer">development and launch</span>, I handle every step with attention to detail and clear communication. I believe in writing clean, maintainable code and following best practices for accessibility, performance, and search engine optimization.`,
		`My development process is collaborative and transparent. I start by understanding your business goals and target audience, then create a roadmap that balances your vision with technical feasibility. Throughout the project, you'll receive regular updates and have opportunities to provide feedback. I use modern tools like <span class="font-bold hover:text-sky-400 cursor-pointer">Git</span> for version control, <span class="font-bold hover:text-sky-400 cursor-pointer">Tailwind CSS</span> for styling, and deployment platforms like Vercel and Netlify for reliable hosting.`,
		`Beyond development, I also have experience in <span class="font-bold hover:text-sky-400 cursor-pointer">quality assurance</span> and testing, which means I pay extra attention to edge cases, browser compatibility, and mobile responsiveness. Every project I deliver is thoroughly tested across devices and browsers to ensure a consistent experience for all users.`,
